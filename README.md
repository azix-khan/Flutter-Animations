# Flutter Animation Project

This repository contains a series of Flutter animation projects, each demonstrated in a separate branch. The branches are organized according to the days of the project, from day 1 to day 10. Each branch showcases different aspects and techniques of Flutter animations.

## Branches

- **main**: The default branch with the combined code of all animation examples.
- **Into_and_Setup**: Initial setup and introduction to Flutter animations.
- **animated_list**: Demonstrates animated lists in Flutter.
- **animation_controllers**: Examples of using animation controllers.
- **built_in_animation**: Utilizes built-in animations provided by Flutter.
- **curve**: Shows how to apply different curves to animations.
- **dart_mixin**: Demonstrates the use of Dart mixins in animations.
- **hero_animation**: Examples of hero animations between routes.
- **stagger_list_animation**: Implements staggered list item animations using Dart's Future and delays.
- **tween_animation**: Demonstrates tween animations in Flutter.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the branches, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-animations.git
   cd flutter-animations
   ```

2. Checkout to the desired branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch_name
   ```
   Replace `branch_name` with the name of the branch you want to explore (e.g., `animated_list`).

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Branch Descriptions

### Into_and_Setup

This branch contains the initial setup for the Flutter animation project. It includes basic configurations and an introduction to Flutter's animation capabilities.

### animated_list

This branch demonstrates how to create animated lists in Flutter. It includes examples of inserting, deleting, and reordering list items with animations.

### animation_controllers

This branch provides examples of using animation controllers to manage and control animations. It covers basic concepts such as animation duration, repeat behavior, and status listeners.

### built_in_animation

This branch showcases the built-in animations provided by Flutter, such as `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`, and more. These widgets simplify adding animations to your app.

### curve

This branch explores different animation curves available in Flutter, such as linear, ease-in, ease-out, and custom curves. It demonstrates how to apply these curves to animations for different effects.

### dart_mixin

This branch demonstrates the use of Dart mixins to organize and reuse animation logic. It includes examples of creating reusable animation mixins for different animation types.

### hero_animation

This branch contains examples of hero animations, which allow you to create smooth transitions between routes by animating a shared widget.

### stagger_list_animation

This branch implements staggered list item animations using Dart's Future and delays. It demonstrates how to create visually appealing staggered animations for list items.

### tween_animation

This branch demonstrates tween animations in Flutter, showing how to interpolate between values to create smooth transitions for various properties.
